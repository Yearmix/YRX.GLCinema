Need to create asp.net mvc application for booking cinema seats.

There are guest and admin pages.
On guest page you are able to book ticket with next information: date, seat#, you name, email, movie title (can be predifined list)
On admin page you are able to see the whole list of booked seats, and you as admin are able to delete items.

Requirements:
Native JS or any JS framework validation on booking page (whatever, name more then 3 symbols, correct email, valid seat#)
Bookings can be stored in memory and pulled from xml during app initialization.

Если зачешь что-то добавть то пожалуйста, но база должна быть вот такой
